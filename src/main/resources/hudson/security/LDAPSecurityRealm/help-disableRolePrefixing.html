<div>
    For backwards compatibility reasons, the LDAP plugin will create a role <code>ROLE_FOO</code> for every role/group
    <code>Foo</code> of a user by default.
    If you're not using these <code>ROLE_*</code> roles in your security configuration and don't want this duplication
    of roles, you can check this option so they'll no longer be created.
