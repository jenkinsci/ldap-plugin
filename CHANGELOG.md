-   Upgrade to [new parent
    pom](https://github.com/jenkinsci/plugin-pom).
-   Integrate Findbugs and fix potential errors discovered by the
    plugin.

### Version 1.11 (3rd Oct 2014)

-   Performance improvements especially in the presence of lots of
    requests with HTTP basic auth.

### Version 1.10.2 (23rd May 2014)

-   Fixed another NPE in FromUserRecordLDAPGroupMembershipStrategy

### Version 1.10.1 (23rd May 2014)

-   Fixed NPE in FromUserRecordLDAPGroupMembershipStrategy.

### Version 1.10 (22nd May 2014)

-   Turned the group membership lookup into a strategy. There are now
    two strategies, the default "look up groups containing the user"
    strategy and an experimental new strategy which looks for an
    attribute in the user's LDAP record that contains a list of DNs of
    the groups that the user belongs to. **Rumour has it that this
    second strategy may actually provide faster performance for Active
    Directory, but as the person who wrote this code does not have an
    Active Directory instance to test against - until some kind soul
    tests, confirms and edits this text to remove the assertion that
    this is a rumour - using the new strategy is** ***Caveat
    emptor*****.**

**\[Update 23/05/2014\] Some kind testers have confirmed that the new
strategy seems to work against Active Directory... but as those testers
did not have performance issues to start with, again it is just a rumour
that there is a performance increase! Version 1.10.2 is recommended to
fix two non-critical but annoying NPEs with the new strategy**

### Version 1.9 (9th May 2014)

-   Added some interim hacks to work around
    [JENKINS-22247](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-22247).
    Setting the temporary system properties 

        hudson.security.LDAPSecurityRealm.forceUsernameLowercase=true

    and 

        hudson.security.LDAPSecurityRealm.forceGroupnameLowercase=true

    will enable these hacks. These system properties will be removed in
    a future version once the core issue has been resolved.

-   Modernised the configuration screen Jelly to use current
    form-binding.
-   The manager password is now correctly encrypted using Secret. This
    is a downgrade breaking change. **WARNING! If you upgrade to 1.9 and
    then downgrade, the manager password may be lost from your
    configuration. **

### Version 1.8 (17th Jan 2014)
